            <h2>Comparing Media Options</h2>
            <p>I considered several different media for sharing my message about wrestling:</p>
            
            <div class="message-box">
                <h3>Website</h3>
                <p>A website allows me to organize my story across multiple pages. Adults can read at their own pace and share it easily. I can create simple HTML and CSS pages, which fits my abilities.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="message-box">
                <h3>Blog Article</h3>
                <p>A blog article would allow for detailed, thoughtful reading. However, it would be harder to organize multiple sections and examples compared to a website with separate pages.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="message-box">
                <h3>Video Essay</h3>
                <p>A video essay could be engaging, but it requires watching time and audio/video access. I don't have video editing skills or equipment, so this wouldn't work for me.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="message-box">
                <h3>Podcast</h3>
                <p>A podcast could reach people who like to listen, but it requires dedicated listening time that busy adults may not have. I also don't have recording equipment or editing software.</p>

            <h2>My Choice: Website</h2>
            <p>I chose a website because it works well for my audience and fits my abilities. Adults can access it easily, read at their own pace, and share it with others. I can create simple HTML and CSS pages to organize my message clearly across multiple pages. A website appears in both the list of media that works for my audience and the list of media I can actually create, making it the best choice.</p>
