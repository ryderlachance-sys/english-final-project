            <h2>Comparing Media Options</h2>
            <p>I thought through a few different ways to share my message about wrestling, resilience, and hard work. I tried to picture what each option would really feel like for me to make.</p>

            <h3>Website</h3>
            <p>A website felt like something I could actually handle. I can split my ideas into pages, and people can read it when they want. I already know basic HTML and CSS, so it doesn't feel overwhelming.</p>

            <h3>Blog Article</h3>
            <p>I also thought about writing a blog article. It would be simple and easy to post, but it would all be on one long page. That makes it harder to separate different parts of my message.</p>

            <h3>Video Essay</h3>
            <p>Another option was a video essay. It could be interesting, but I don't have editing skills or good equipment. I also know that people have to sit and watch the whole thing, which doesn't always happen.</p>

            <h3>Podcast</h3>
            <p>I considered a podcast too. It sounds cool, but I don't have recording tools, and I would need to edit audio. Adults might not have time to listen all the way through, so it doesn't feel like the best fit.</p>

            <h2>My Choice: Website</h2>
            <p>In the end, a website makes the most sense for me. I can build it with the skills I already have, and it lets me organize my thoughts clearly. It also fits how I want people to read my story and think about wrestling, resilience, and hard work.</p>
