            <h2>My Target Audience</h2>
            <p>My message about how wrestling helps clear my mind and teaches me to handle losses is aimed at adults. Specifically, I'm thinking about adults who are parents or guardians of teenagers, adults who coach or work with youth athletes, and adults who are dealing with stress or loss in their own lives.</p>
            <p>These adults want to understand activities that help young people develop resilience and mental health skills. They're interested in how sports can teach life lessons beyond just winning and losing. Some might also be looking for personal strategies to handle difficult situations and clear their minds.</p>

            <h2>Why a Website Works for My Audience</h2>
            <p>Adults can access a website easily, read at their own pace, bookmark it for later, and share it with others. A website feels professional and trustworthy, which is important when talking about serious topics like handling losses and mental health. Unlike social media posts that are too quick and casual, or podcasts that require dedicated listening time, a website allows for detailed, thoughtful reading when it's convenient.</p>
