            <h2>Possible Messages</h2>
            <p>Based on my personal experiences with wrestling, here are possible messages I could communicate:</p>
            
            <div class="message-box">
                <h3>Wrestling helps clear my mind</h3>
                <p>When I'm on the mat, I have to focus completely on the match. This helps me forget about stress and worries, and my mind feels clearer after practice.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="message-box">
                <h3>Wrestling teaches me how to handle losses</h3>
                <p>I lose matches sometimes, and wrestling has taught me to learn from losses instead of just feeling bad about them. This helps me in other parts of my life too.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="message-box">
                <h3>Wrestling helps me stay mentally healthy</h3>
                <p>Wrestling gives me a way to deal with stress and build resilience. It's not just a sport, it's a way to stay mentally healthy.</p>
